## Usage

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
```

### Use a counter with a series

```php
use SertxuDeveloper\Counters\Counter;

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES', series: 'N');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 2

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES', series: 'R');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
```

### Use a counter with a year

```php
use SertxuDeveloper\Counters\Counter;

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES', year: '2023');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 2

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES', year: '2024');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
```

### Use a counter with a year and a series

```php
use SertxuDeveloper\Counters\Counter;

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES', year: '2023', series: 'N');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 2

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES', year: '2023', series: 'R');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES', year: '2024', series: 'N');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
```

### Decrement a counter

```php
use SertxuDeveloper\Counters\Counter;

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 2

$invoice->number = $counter->decrement(); // 1
```

### Custom increment

```php
use SertxuDeveloper\Counters\Counter;

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
$invoice->number = $counter->increment(5); // 6
```

### Custom decrement

```php
use SertxuDeveloper\Counters\Counter;

$counter = Counter::make('INVOICES');

$invoice->number = $counter->next(); // 1
$invoice->number = $counter->increment(5); // 6
